# Robotics_Project1
This is a demonstration of the creation of a Gazebo World and a plugin

To execute the Project:

1. Clone the Repository "Robotics_Project1" to your /home/<user> directory
	
        cd ~
        git clone https://github.com/andreslc47/Robotics_Project1.git
        cd ~/Robotics_Project1/
        
	
2. Create a "build" directory and compile the project
	
        mkdir build
	cd build/
	cmake ../
	make
 
	
3. Open 3 terminals.

    



4. In Gazebo, move the white ball in front of the robot so that it can follow it.

	
5. To close everything:

        cd ~/Robotics_Project2/
        ./pkill_all
